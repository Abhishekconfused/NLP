Hi this branch contains my work. I will mention which are for my reference and which are for final submission.
I refered to you tube videos and read few repos.
The repo of submission is Final.ipynb
I first converted pdf to image using fliz and io( I actually dont know much about these got help from a repo and used chatgpt for error correction. Google AI helped a lot.
I used my knowledge of pytesseract from learn1, learn2 , learn3 and solved.
I tried noice removing function at a point but I found that it was actually removing texts so I avoided it. 
One thing I would like to confess is in learn 3 I tried to learn how to deal with index and table but ended up getting confused so just copy pasted code from a repo.
Please see the Final file in google colab as my laptop was not able to do it so I used google colab.
